<h2>Summary of Project</h2>
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe games. Sticked with KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid) principles. Used if statement, for loop, DOM manipulation to complete this game

<h2>Plan</h2>

Step1: Preparation

1. Think about the basic elements and bonus elements I need to add to this project.

    1.1 Switch Turns
    use odd and even method to switch the player

    1.2 Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
        
        1.2.1 use sample code blow:
```
if (box0.className === 'circle' && box1.className === 'circle' && box2.className === 'circle') {
        winner1.textContent = "Congrats! Player 1 win!"
        winner2.textContent = "Click REST button to continue!"
```
2. Find out the difficult part I may face. 
    2.1 Add button sould effect
